# PAC-MAN-GAME
PAC-man is a classic arcade game, where the user has to use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate(left,right,up,down) and eat all the white dots, 
make sure the Pac-man agent does not touch the red dots that roam the maze. In this project, the PAC-man agent will find paths through its maze world, 
both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently and the PAC-man agent is identified as the green dot in the maze, 
where the user uses it to play the game and collect food to gain more points. If the PAC-man agent touches the red dot, the game stops and starts again, 
but the user ends up losing a life, the user gets to have only three lifelines and once all the lifelines are used the game stops and restarts all over again 
till you complete the task of eating all the white dots and go to the finish line. This project is developed on python programming language using the necessary 
libraries and user-defined functions and a lot more. The aim of this project is for the user to have a good time and relax.
